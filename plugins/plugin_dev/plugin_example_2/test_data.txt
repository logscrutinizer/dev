Log for Example 2, demonstrating how to develop a plugin with decode function

The values below are Q87 encoded, that is a fixed number representation for float number. So if you have a float
number you multiply it with 2^7  (128) to get a fix number representation. When you want it back to float value you
simply divide the number with 2^7. 

Since it is very difficult to read Q87 number (and "see the float") it is easy to extend the LogScrutinizer with
a plugin that "on-the-fly" decodes these numbers and have the more readable (float representation) shown

The values "hidden" below where 1.1 2.2 3.3 4.4 5.5 and 6.6 before they where converted to Q87. You will see that when
converting them back we have lost precision because of the limited Q87.

Time:0 Value:140
Time:1 Value:563
Time:2 Value:704
Time:3 Value:844
Time:4 Value:704
Time:5 Value:422
Time:6 Value:140
Time:7 Value:281
Time:8 Value:140
Time:9 Value:140
